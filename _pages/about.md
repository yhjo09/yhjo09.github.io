I am a Staff Engineer at <a href="https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/" target="\_blank">SAIT (Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology).</a>
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Yonsei University advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/seonjookim" target="\_blank">Seon Joo Kim</a>.

My research interests focus on Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
Particularly, I am interested in deep learning based image/video restoration (super-resolution, deblurring, ...) and image quality assessment.
